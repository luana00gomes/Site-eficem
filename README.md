# Energy Efficiency Team Website
This is the version I programmed in 2018 for the Energy Efficiency Team at UFSC. It served as a foundation for other developers to later add written content and make the website more dynamic.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add more images to the site</li>
  
<li>Create a database system to separate text content from HTML files</li>

<li>Optimize team member photos by reducing image quality to enhance site performance</li>

<li>Update fonts to improve layout and readability</li>

<li>Add JavaScript effects for interactivity</li>

<li>Fix PHP form error (messages arenâ€™t being sent to email correctly)</li>

<li>Add a footer tag to complete the site structure</li>

</ul>
